# Salifort-Motors
Building predictive models to improve employee satisfaction level at Salifort Motors company.

## Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.
The HR department at Salifort Motors wanted to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, and they did not know what to do with it. They refer to me as a data analytics professional and ask me to provide data-driven suggestions based on my understanding of the data. They have the following question: whatâ€™s likely to make the employee leave the company?
